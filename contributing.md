# Developing new features and fixing bugs
## Step 1. Get You A Copy
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your local machine
3. (Optional but helpful) Create a branch for your changes with `git checkout -b branchname`.  Make your branchname short but descriptive, eg `add_contribution_doc`

## Step 2. Set up your environment
1. Make sure you've a JDK installed, along with Maven, and all the appropriate ENV Vars set

## Step 3. Make your changes

## Step 4. Commit
1. List changed files with `git status`
2. Add relevant changed files to your commit with `git add filename`
3. Start your commit with `git commit`
4. Write a good commit message.  Good messages have a short title describing what changed, as well as a longer message summarising the changes with any context required. If fixing a lodged issue, mention this in the title
5. Try to commit atomic bug fixes or features, or at least a related set of features

## Step 5. Send a Pull Request
